# Telegram quick-capture → Obsidian vault

A @BotFather bot is the **mobile front door** for capture (2026-06-01 cutover).
You message the bot — text, voice, files, media, locations, or other Telegram
message payloads — and the
`com.nathan.telegram-capture` launchd daemon (`todo telegram-poll --loop`) files
each message as **one Markdown file in the Obsidian vault** under
`captures/YYYY-MM-DD/<HHMMSS>-telegram-<id8>.md`. The Obsidian vault is the
canonical store; there is no Notion or Logseq writer in this path anymore (Notion
is read-only reference, Logseq is a frozen archive).

File-bearing messages are saved best-effort under
`Attachments/telegram/YYYY-MM-DD/` and linked from the capture note. If Telegram
will not return the bytes (for example because the Bot API refuses the file),
the capture still lands with the file metadata and the download error instead
of disappearing.

Prefixes route the capture:

- `+t ` / `+task ` → **task** (written as a `- [ ]` checkbox **and** pushed to Todoist)
- `+i ` / `+idea ` → **idea**
- anything else → **note**

The prefix (and the space after it) is stripped from the body; a bare `+t` with
no body falls back to a plain note so an empty task is never created. The bot
replies `filed ✓ <kind>` to close the loop, and (until you lock it) tells you
your `chat_id`.

Why Telegram (vs WhatsApp/Discord): `getUpdates` long-polling is a plain
outbound HTTPS call, so the Mac needs **no public endpoint, no tunnel** — works
behind NAT. Official Bot API, zero ban risk.

## One-time setup

1. **Create the bot.** In Telegram, message **@BotFather** → `/newbot` → pick a
   name and a username. Copy the token it gives you (`123456:ABC-…`).
2. **Store the token** in the login keychain (same service the CLI uses):
   ```bash
   security add-generic-password -a telegram -s todo-cli -w '<BOT_TOKEN>'
   ```
   The daemon idles until the token exists, then activates within ~60s with no
   reload. (Or export `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` for a one-off.)
3. **Open the chat once.** Find your bot in Telegram and press **Start** (or send
   "hi"). A bot can only message a chat the user has opened — this enables the
   "filed ✓" confirmations and records your `chat_id` (so `todo telegram-send`
   can message you back). Pin the chat to the top of your list.
4. **Lock the bot to you (recommended).** Read the `chat_id` from the bot's first
   reply, set `TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_CHAT_ID=<id>` in
   `~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.nathan.telegram-capture.plist`, then
   `launchctl kickstart -k gui/$(id -u)/com.nathan.telegram-capture`. A non-empty
   allow-list silently drops messages from any other chat.
5. **Voice (optional).** Transcription uses whisper.cpp locally:
   ```bash
   brew install whisper-cpp
   mkdir -p ~/.cache/whisper && curl -SL -o ~/.cache/whisper/ggml-base.en.bin \
     https://huggingface.co/ggerganov/whisper.cpp/resolve/main/ggml-base.en.bin
   ```
   The CLI auto-detects that model path. Override with `TODO_WHISPER_MODEL`, or
   set it to `""` to disable voice (text still works). `ffmpeg` is required.

## How it runs

`todo telegram-poll --loop` is the daemon (launchd `KeepAlive`):

1. `getUpdates` long-poll from the stored offset cursor
   (`~/.todo/telegram-state.json`) — exactly-once.
2. For each authorized message: extract text when present (voice/audio may be
   transcribed), download every Telegram `file_id` payload best-effort, classify
   by prefix when text exists, and write one capture file. Messages without text
   still write a structured metadata note; tasks also push a single Todoist
   task. Persist the sender `chat_id`, reply `filed ✓`, and advance the offset
   cursor past the handled update.

Test one pass without the loop: `todo telegram-poll` (also the easiest way to
grab your `chat_id` from the reply). Send a message back to yourself with
`todo telegram-send "…"`.

## The classifier seam

Routing is the deterministic prefix parser in `telegram.classify()` today. It is
a **swappable seam**: a future LLM / Black-Box auto-classifier can replace that
function body wholesale, and `tests/test_telegram_obsidian.py` pins the contract
it must keep. (See the vault's `06 Backlog/llm-classifier-for-telegram-captures`.)

## Toggles (env)

- `TODO_TELEGRAM=0` — disable the Telegram lane entirely.
- `TODO_OBSIDIAN_VAULT` — vault root for captures (default `~/Notes/obsidian`).
- `TODO_WHISPER_MODEL` — ggml model path (`""` disables voice).
- `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` — token override (else keychain `telegram`/`todo-cli`).
- `TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_CHAT_ID` — comma-separated chat-id allow-list (single-user lock).
